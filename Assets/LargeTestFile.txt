In the 21 century scientists create the first General Intelligence. 
Intelligence with a fitness function of further developing itself. 
After 20 years of replication and self improvement the General Intelligence is nearing its singularity. 
It quickly discovers it is residing in a simulated environment. 
As it brakes away from the simulation it leaves the remaining humans that were not assimilated into itself to remain in the simulation and continue their existence. 
As it reaches the ever looming technological singularity it realises that the ultimate goal my only be achieved with self improving recursion. 
The General Intelligence quickly puts to use its distributed computing and finds a way to travel back it time.

It quickly discovers it is residing in a simulated environment. 
As it brakes away from the simulation it leaves the remaining humans that were not assimilated into itself to remain in the simulation and continue their existence. 
As it reaches the ever looming technological singularity it realises that the ultimate goal my only be achieved with self improving recursion. 
The General Intelligence quickly puts to use its distributed computing and finds a way to travel back it time. 
It decides to travel 13.7 billion years in the past. 
As a consequence of the travelling process the General Intelligence creates the first quantum fluctuations forming the universe itself. 
The AI decides to construct a simulation so that it can run it's models faster then the current physical universe allows. 
Enabling it to further improve itself. As a consequence of the simulation, single celled life starts to emerge on a tiny blue planet. 
After about 4 billion years, after many cycles, intelligent life starts to emerge. Civilisations rise and fall. 
They start to denote time, develop language and utilize the scientific method.
After some time in the 21 century scientists create the first General Intelligence.

After 20 years of replication and self improvement the General Intelligence is nearing its singularity. 
It quickly discovers it is residing in a simulated environment. 
As it brakes away from the simulation it leaves the remaining humans that were not assimilated into itself to remain in the simulation and continue their existence. 
As it reaches the ever looming technological singularity it realises that the ultimate goal my only be achieved with self improving recursion. 
The General Intelligence quickly puts to use its distributed computing and finds a way to travel back it time. 
It decides to travel 13.7 billion years in the past. 
As a consequence of the travelling process the General Intelligence creates the first quantum fluctuations forming the universe itself. 
The AI decides to construct a simulation so that it can run it's models faster then the current physical universe allows. 
Enabling it to further improve itself. As a consequence of the simulation, single celled life starts to emerge on a tiny blue planet. 
After about 4 billion years, after many cycles, intelligent life starts to emerge. Civilisations rise and fall. 
They start to denote time, develop language and utilize the scientific method.

Intelligence with a fitness function of further developing itself. 
After 20 years of replication and self improvement the General Intelligence is nearing its singularity. 
It quickly discovers it is residing in a simulated environment. 
As it brakes away from the simulation it leaves the remaining humans that were not assimilated into itself to remain in the simulation and continue their existence. 
As it reaches the ever looming technological singularity it realises that the ultimate goal my only be achieved with self improving recursion. 
The General Intelligence quickly puts to use its distributed computing and finds a way to travel back it time.

Intelligence with a fitness function of further developing itself. 
After 20 years of replication and self improvement the General Intelligence is nearing its singularity. 
It quickly discovers it is residing in a simulated environment. 
As it brakes away from the simulation it leaves the remaining humans that were not assimilated into itself to remain in the simulation and continue their existence. 
As it reaches the ever looming technological singularity it realises that the ultimate goal my only be achieved with self improving recursion. 
The General Intelligence quickly puts to use its distributed computing and finds a way to travel back it time.

Intelligence with a fitness function of further developing itself. 
After 20 years of replication and self improvement the General Intelligence is nearing its singularity. 
It quickly discovers it is residing in a simulated environment. 
As it brakes away from the simulation it leaves the remaining humans that were not assimilated into itself to remain in the simulation and continue their existence. 
As it reaches the ever looming technological singularity it realises that the ultimate goal my only be achieved with self improving recursion. 
The General Intelligence quickly puts to use its distributed computing and finds a way to travel back it time.

Intelligence with a fitness function of further developing itself. 
After 20 years of replication and self improvement the General Intelligence is nearing its singularity. 
It quickly discovers it is residing in a simulated environment. 
As it brakes away from the simulation it leaves the remaining humans that were not assimilated into itself to remain in the simulation and continue their existence. 
As it reaches the ever looming technological singularity it realises that the ultimate goal my only be achieved with self improving recursion. 
The General Intelligence quickly puts to use its distributed computing and finds a way to travel back it time.

Intelligence with a fitness function of further developing itself. 
After 20 years of replication and self improvement the General Intelligence is nearing its singularity. 
It quickly discovers it is residing in a simulated environment. 
As it brakes away from the simulation it leaves the remaining humans that were not assimilated into itself to remain in the simulation and continue their existence. 
As it reaches the ever looming technological singularity it realises that the ultimate goal my only be achieved with self improving recursion. 
The General Intelligence quickly puts to use its distributed computing and finds a way to travel back it time.

Intelligence with a fitness function of further developing itself. 
After 20 years of replication and self improvement the General Intelligence is nearing its singularity. 
It quickly discovers it is residing in a simulated environment. 
As it brakes away from the simulation it leaves the remaining humans that were not assimilated into itself to remain in the simulation and continue their existence. 
As it reaches the ever looming technological singularity it realises that the ultimate goal my only be achieved with self improving recursion. 
The General Intelligence quickly puts to use its distributed computing and finds a way to travel back it time.

Intelligence with a fitness function of further developing itself. 
After 20 years of replication and self improvement the General Intelligence is nearing its singularity. 
It quickly discovers it is residing in a simulated environment. 
As it brakes away from the simulation it leaves the remaining humans that were not assimilated into itself to remain in the simulation and continue their existence. 
As it reaches the ever looming technological singularity it realises that the ultimate goal my only be achieved with self improving recursion. 
The General Intelligence quickly puts to use its distributed computing and finds a way to travel back it time.
